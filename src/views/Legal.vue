        website and any of its products or services (collectively,
        &quot;Website&quot; or &quot;Services&quot;). It also describes the
        choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information
        and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not
        apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to

      </p>

      <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>

        We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when
        you fill any online forms on the Website. You can choose not to provide
        us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take
        advantage of some of the Website's features. Users who are uncertain
        about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
      </p>

      <h2>Collection of non-personal information</h2>

      <p>
        When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information
        that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your
        device's IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and
        version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before
        you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time
        spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access
        times and dates, and other statistics.
      </p>

      <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>

      <p>
        Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize
        your experience; improve our Website; improve customer service and
        respond to queries and emails of our customers; run and operate our
        Website and Services. Non-Personal Information collected is used only to
        identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information
        regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise
        aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the
        system.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the
        following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more
        specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed
        to process information until you object to such processing (by opting
        out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
        legal bases below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
        processing of Personal Information is subject to European data
        protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the
        performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
        obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a
        legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to
        a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
        official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the
        purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
        In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that
        applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
        Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
        requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
      </p>

      <h2>Information transfer and storage</h2>

      <p>
        Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and
        storing your information in a country other than your own. You are
        entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a
        country outside the European Union or to any international organization
        governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries,
        such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard
        your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out
        more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with
        us using the information provided in the contact section.
      </p>

      <h2>The rights of users</h2>

      <p>
        You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by
        us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have
        the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your
        consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right
        to object to the processing of your information if the processing is
        carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the
        right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain
        disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy
        of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to
        verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or
        corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to
        restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not
        process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you
        have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of
        your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive
        your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable
        format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another
        controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided
        that your information is processed by automated means and that the
        processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of
        or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
      </p>

      <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>

      <p>
        Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the
        exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of
        the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
        processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to
        justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal
        Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object
        to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To
        learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct
        marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this
        document.
      </p>

      <h2>How to exercise these rights</h2>

      <p>
        Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner
        through the contact details provided in this document. These requests
        can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by the Owner as
        early as possible and always within one month.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy of children</h2>

      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under
        the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any
        Personal Information through our Website or Service. We encourage
        parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage
        and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to
        provide Personal Information through our Website or Service without
        their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the
        age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through our Website or
        Service, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to
        consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some
        countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>

      <p>
        The Website uses &quot;cookies&quot; to help personalize your online
        experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by
        a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
        viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can
        only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to
        you. We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for
        statistical purposes to operate our Website and Services. You have the
        ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
        accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to
        decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may
        not be able to fully experience the features of the Website and
        Services. To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit

      </p>

      <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>

      <p>
        Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
        websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
        tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in
        connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
        collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or
        visit a website or online service as they move across different websites
        over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet
        uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to interpret or
        respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so,
        as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and
        collection of your personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>Links to other websites</h2>

      <p>
        Our Website contains links to other websites that are not owned or
        controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the
        privacy practices of such other websites or third-parties. We encourage
        you to be aware when you leave our Website and to read the privacy
        statements of each and every website that may collect Personal
        Information.
      </p>

      <h2>Information security</h2>

      <p>
        We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled,
        secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or
        disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
        physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access,
        use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in its control
        and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless
        network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your
        Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and
        privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii)
        the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
        exchanged between you and our Website cannot be guaranteed; and (iii)
        any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit
        by a third-party, despite best efforts.
      </p>

      <h2>Data breach</h2>

      <p>
        In the event we become aware that the security of the Website has been
        compromised or users Personal Information has been disclosed to
        unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but
        not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take
        reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to,
        investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation
        with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will
        make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe
        that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the
        breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will
        post a notice on the Website.
      </p>

      <h2>Legal disclosure</h2>

      <p>
        We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required
        or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal
        process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary
        to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
        investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
        Website Operator, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
